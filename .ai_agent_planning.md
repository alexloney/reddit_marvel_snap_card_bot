## Issue #23

### Files to Modify
- `snap_bot\main.py`

### Files to Create


### Implementation Plan
### Reasoning

The requirement is to update the link in the comment made by the bot from a direct GitHub repository link to a pre-populated issue creation link. This new link should include a reference back to the Reddit comment that triggered the bot's response, facilitating easier debugging and tracking of issues.

**Files to Modify:**
- **snap_bot/main.py**: This file contains the logic for generating the response message that includes the GitHub repository link. It needs to be updated to generate a pre-populated issue creation URL with the Reddit comment URL included in the body.
- **tests/test_main.py**: If such a test file exists, it should be updated or created to ensure the new functionality is tested.

**New Files:**
- No new files need to be created for this specific task. However, if there isn't already a test file for `main.py`, one should be created to cover this new feature.

### Logical Sequence of Changes
1. **Identify the location in `snap_bot/main.py` where the GitHub link is added**: This will likely be within a method that constructs the response message.
2. **Modify the URL construction logic**: Replace the static GitHub repository URL with a dynamically generated issue creation URL that includes the Reddit comment URL as part of its body.
3. **Update tests**: Ensure there are tests to verify that the new URL is correctly constructed and included in the response.

### Edge Cases and Side Effects
- **URL Encoding**: The Reddit comment URL should be properly encoded to ensure it is safely included in the query parameter of the GitHub issue creation URL.
- **Length Limits**: Check if there are any limits on the length of the body text for GitHub issues that could affect including a full Reddit comment URL.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure that any errors in constructing the URL do not cause the bot to fail or produce incorrect output.

### Testing
- Update existing tests or create new ones in `tests/test_main.py` to verify that the generated link includes the correct Reddit comment URL and is properly formatted.
- Consider edge cases such as very long URLs and ensure they are handled correctly.

### Documentation
- Update any relevant documentation, including comments within the code, to reflect the changes made. Ensure that the purpose of the new URL construction logic is clearly explained.

### Implementation Plan

REASONING: The requirement involves updating the GitHub link in the bot's response message to a pre-populated issue creation link with a reference back to the Reddit comment. This change will be implemented in `snap_bot/main.py` and tested in `tests/test_main.py`.
