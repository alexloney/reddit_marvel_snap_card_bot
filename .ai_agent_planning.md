## Issue #23

### Files to Modify
- `tests\test_comment_parser.py`
- `snap_bot\main.py`

### Files to Create
- `(None needed)`

### Implementation Plan
### REASONING

The requirement is to update the link in the comment made by the bot on Reddit. Currently, it points to the GitHub repository for reporting issues. Instead, we need to modify this link so that it directs users to create a new issue in the GitHub repository and pre-populates the body of the issue with a reference back to the original Reddit comment.

To achieve this, we will need to:
1. Identify where the current link is being constructed.
2. Modify the construction of this link to include the necessary query parameters for creating a new issue with a pre-filled body.
3. Ensure that the URL of the Reddit comment is correctly included in the pre-filled body text.

The relevant file identified from the search results is `snap_bot/main.py`, where the response message including the GitHub link is constructed. No additional files need to be created, but we will update this file and potentially add or modify tests if necessary.

### LOGICAL SEQUENCE OF CHANGES

1. **Identify the location of the current link construction**: This is done in `snap_bot/main.py` where the response message is being built.
2. **Modify the GitHub URL to include query parameters for creating a new issue with a pre-filled body**:
   - Use the format: `https://github.com/alexloney/reddit_marvel_snap_card_bot/issues/new?body=[Original Comment](<Reddit_Comment_URL>)`
3. **Ensure that the Reddit comment URL is correctly included in the link**: This will require accessing the `url` attribute of the `Comment` object.
4. **Update tests if necessary to ensure the new functionality works as expected**.

### EDGE CASES AND SIDE EFFECTS

- **Edge Case**: If the `Comment` object does not have a URL, we should handle this gracefully (e.g., by using a default message or skipping the pre-filled body).
- **Side Effect**: The change might affect how users interact with the bot and report issues. We need to ensure that the new link is user-friendly and clearly indicates its purpose.

### TESTING

We will need to update existing tests in `tests/test_comment_parser.py` (or create new ones) to verify that the new link is constructed correctly and includes the Reddit comment URL.

### DOCUMENTATION AND CONFIGURATION FILES

No additional configuration files or documentation changes are required beyond updating the code comments if necessary to reflect the change.
